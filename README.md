## Genetic Algoritm
### df local maximum in Quadratic Function between 0 and 255

This is Genetic AI that I made on studies.

##Basicly
> It works on command line input and *result.txt* output.
> On input you have to pass 3 numbers that are integers and are assigned to **A B C** in general formula in quadratic function **Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C**.
> On output you will see a 40 results that AI gives as an answer in sequences **f(x) x** line by line 40 times.

##Details
> At the begining we generate **populations** times ***Genotypes***.
> Then we going to loop that is limited by rule  **populations** * **generations** <= 150.
> In loop we **mutate**, **cross**, and then **select** our ***Genotypes***:
>> **mutate**:

>> **cross**:

>> **select**:

> After the loop ends we write out our best ***Genotype*** and so 40 times.
